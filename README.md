# Bang Engine Example

This will be expanded to include more features of the engine as they develop. It is meant to serve as a starting point to get familiar with the engine's architecture and its state of development so you can decide whether or not it's an appropriate time investment for your goals.

## How To Run

First, [install Odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/).
Then, clone [this repo](https://github.com/thecodekitchen/bang).
Follow the instructions there for compiling the assimp bindings. This process will be simplified soon, I hope.
Finally, clone this repo into the same parent directory where you cloned Bang, cd into it, and run
```
odin run .
```

The engine is still in its infancy, so contributions and suggestions are highly valued.

Have fun!
